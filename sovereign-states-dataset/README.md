## Who are the source Data producers ?
The data is machine-generated (using web scraping) and subjected to human additional treatment.

below, I provide the script I created to scrape the data (as well as my additional treatment):

import scrapy


class StatesspiderSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'statesspider'
    start_urls = ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states']

    def parse(self, response):
        rows = response.xpath('//table[contains(@class, "wikitable")][1]//tr')  # Locate the main table

        for row in rows[1:]:  # Skip the header row
            common_and_formal_names = row.xpath('td[1]//text()').getall()  # First column
            membership_within_un_system = row.xpath('td[2]//text()').getall()  # Second column
            sovereignty_dispute = row.xpath('td[3]//text()').getall()  # Third column
            further_information = row.xpath('td[4]//text()').getall()  # Fourth column

            # Clean up and join text lists
            common_and_formal_names = ' '.join(common_and_formal_names).strip()
            membership_within_un_system = ' '.join(membership_within_un_system).strip()
            sovereignty_dispute = ' '.join(sovereignty_dispute).strip()
            further_information = ' '.join(further_information).strip()

            yield {
                'Common and Formal Names': common_and_formal_names,
                'Membership within the UN System': membership_within_un_system,
                'Sovereignty Dispute': sovereignty_dispute,
                'Further Information': further_information,
            }

## Usage

### Loading the Dataset in Python
To use the dataset in Python, you can load it using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/your-username/sovereign-states-dataset/resolve/main/sovereign_states_cleaned_final.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Preview the dataset
print(df.head())
